// im still learning about thread management using tokio,
// so it currently wip atleast the api are working normally
// i planned to use rustyline and clap so it UI task (repl interface) and clap as command parser.
// gonna make it REPL-like but if there's an argument then it just run single command.
// the interface would be heavily inspired by some cli apps for example iwctl (iwd), or bluetoothctl.
